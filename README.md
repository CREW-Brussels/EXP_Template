# EXP Template
EXP Template is a ready-to-use Unreal Engine 5.3 project, that gathers all of our submodules developed within our EXP Framework, a framework for multiplayer embodied XR experiences.

Every asset developped is in the Plugins folder of this template, but you can find how all of the submodules work in details on our [EXP](https://github.com/CREW-Brussels/EXP) page or in our [wiki](https://github.com/CREW-Brussels/EXP/wiki)!
